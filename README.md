 Serial Communication, can be used as a serial monitor for sending and receive data.
>* Full Customization of the graphs, add, change, delete, The Ui file is on the code so you can edit it, also can add more "blocks" on the topbar for displaying data that does not need a graph. 
>* Simulation mode for use without hardware, you can change the time for each update.
>* UnPlug Detection, if you unplug de device without desconecting your computer is going to beep :)
>* Display of the current time, is displayed in CET but you can change that also.

* **Custom Graphs**
> Modifying the graphs is really easy, go to *./edvs/modules/managers/graph_manager.py*, first create a new object with the class of the graph you want to use in the *set_graph()* function, also you need to add it to a layout, you can use the existing ones as example. Then you need to add the update function of your graph with the respective data into the *update()* function. For modifying the graph objects go to *./edvs/modules/utility/graph_types.py* and have fun!

* **Terminal Commands:**
> Type "*/help*" to show all the command in the terminal line, if the message start with the command prefix (you can change it in the config) the data is not sent, but interpreted as a command.

* **Dummy:**
>* "*/dummy.on*" for starting the simulation
>* "*/dummy.off*" you can guess
>* "*/dummy.time* <time>" change the update time for the data to appear, time need to be a float and in seconds, 0.5 for half a second 1.0 for a second.

* **Unplug Mode:**
> Unplug it !!

* **Saves**
> The record button saves all the data comming from the serial port to a csv file, you can open the folder in config tab or by a typing "/saves" in the terminal.

## Known bugs
>* Graphs Randomly resize depending on the data
>* The full timeline is not shown in the x axis of the graph
